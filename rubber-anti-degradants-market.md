<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rubber Anti-degradants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Amine Antidegradants</li><li>Phenolic Antidegradants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rubber anti-degradants are additives used to prevent rubber materials from deteriorating over time. There are two main types of rubber anti-degradants: amine antidegradants and phenolic antidegradants. Amine antidegradants work by inhibiting the oxidation process in rubber, protecting it from degradation. Phenolic antidegradants, on the other hand, function by reacting with free radicals that cause degradation. Both types of anti-degradants are crucial in maintaining the durability and performance of rubber materials in various applications.</p></p>
