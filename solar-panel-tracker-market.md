<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Panel Tracker Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-axis Tracker</li><li>Dual-axis Tracker</li></ul></p>
<p><p>There are two main types of solar panel trackers on the market: Single-axis and Dual-axis. </p><p>Single-axis trackers follow the sun's path throughout the day by rotating on one axis, typically from east to west. This increases energy production compared to fixed panels but is less expensive than dual-axis trackers.</p><p>Dual-axis trackers move in two directions, following both the sun's daily path and its seasonal variations. While more costly than single-axis trackers, dual-axis systems can generate even more energy and have higher efficiency rates.</p></p>
