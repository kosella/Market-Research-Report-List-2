<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metalworking Coolants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-water Soluble</li><li>Water Soluble</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Metalworking coolants can be divided into two main types: non-water soluble and water soluble. Non-water soluble coolants are oil-based and do not mix with water, making them effective for heavy-duty machining operations that generate high heat. They provide lubrication and corrosion protection. On the other hand, water soluble coolants are mixed with water and form a milky emulsion. They are easier to clean up and are more environmentally friendly. Water soluble coolants are preferred for light to moderate machining operations.</p></p>
