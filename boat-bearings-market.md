<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Boat Bearings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rolling Bearing</li><li>Sliding Bearing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Boat bearings can be categorized into two main types: rolling bearings and sliding bearings. Rolling bearings are designed with rolling elements between two rings, allowing for smooth rotational motion with minimal friction. In contrast, sliding bearings use a sliding motion between two surfaces to achieve movement. Rolling bearings are commonly used in applications where high precision and durability are required, while sliding bearings are more suitable for heavy load and low-speed applications. Both types play a crucial role in the functioning of boats and marine equipment.</p></p>
