<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Birefringent Materials Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Uniaxial Crystal</li><li>Biaxial Crystal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Birefringent materials are classified into two main types: Uniaxial Crystals and Biaxial Crystals. Uniaxial crystals have one optical axis along which the speed of light is constant, leading to two different refractive indices in perpendicular directions. Biaxial crystals, on the other hand, have two optical axes with varying refractive indices along different axes. Both types of crystals exhibit double refraction, where light is split into two rays with different speeds and directions, making them valuable in various optical applications.</p></p>
