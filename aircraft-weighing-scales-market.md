<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Weighing Scales Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Platform</li><li>Floor-standing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aircraft weighing scales can be categorized into two main types: platform scales and floor-standing scales. Platform scales are designed with a large, flat surface where aircraft can be placed for weighing. They are usually stationary and used for larger aircraft. Floor-standing scales, on the other hand, are more portable and can be easily moved around. They are ideal for smaller aircraft and can be placed directly on the floor for weighing purposes. Both types of scales are essential for ensuring accurate weight measurements for aircraft maintenance and operations.</p></p>
