<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermometer Guns Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-contact Type</li><li>Contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermometer guns are used for measuring temperature, with two main types - non-contact and contact. Non-contact thermometers are held close to the object being measured, emitting infrared radiation to calculate temperature. They are suitable for measuring moving objects or those at a distance. In contrast, contact thermometers require physical contact with the object to measure its temperature accurately. Both types have their own market, with non-contact thermometers being popular in industrial settings and contact thermometers commonly used in medical and household applications.</p></p>
