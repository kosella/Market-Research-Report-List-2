<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Volumetric Display Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Swept-Volume Display</li><li>Solid-Volume Display</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Volumetric displays are classified into two main types: swept-volume displays and solid-volume displays. Swept-volume displays create 3D images by rapidly moving a 2D display through a volume of space, creating the illusion of depth. Solid-volume displays, on the other hand, generate 3D images by illuminating points in a 3D space using lasers or other light sources. Both types of displays are used in various applications such as medical imaging, flight simulation, and advertising to create realistic 3D visuals.</p></p>
