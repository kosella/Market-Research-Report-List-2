<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid Leak Detection Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Leak Detection</li><li>Non-Invasive Leak Detection</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Invasive leak detection equipment requires physically penetrating the surface or structure being monitored to access the potential leak sources. This type of equipment is typically used in situations where a leak is suspected but not easily visible. Non-invasive leak detection equipment, on the other hand, is designed to detect leaks without the need for physical intrusion. This type of equipment is often used in sensitive or hard-to-reach areas where invasive methods may not be feasible. Both types of equipment play a vital role in ensuring the safety and integrity of various systems and structures.</p></p>
