<p><strong>The Selective Herbicides Safener Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre-emergence</li><li>Post-emergence</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Selective herbicides safeners are used in both pre-emergence and post-emergence applications in the market. Pre-emergence herbicides are applied before weed seeds start to germinate, preventing their growth. Post-emergence herbicides are applied after weeds have already sprouted, targeting established plants. Safeners are crucial in ensuring that the herbicides only affect the target weeds and not the desired crops. This selective approach minimizes damage to crops and maximizes weed control efficiency.</p></p>
