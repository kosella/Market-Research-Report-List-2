<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water Detection Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Water Sensors</li><li>Non-contacting Water Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Contact water sensors come in direct contact with water to detect water presence. These sensors are commonly used in applications where water contact is necessary for detection, such as water tanks. Non-contacting water sensors, on the other hand, do not require direct contact with water to detect its presence. These sensors typically use technologies like ultrasonic or infrared to detect water level without touching the water itself, making them suitable for applications where direct contact is not possible or desired, such as in industrial settings or sensitive environments.</p></p>
