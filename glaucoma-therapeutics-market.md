<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glaucoma Therapeutics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Prostaglandin Analogs</li><li>Beta Blockers</li><li>Alpha Agonists</li><li>Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Glaucoma therapeutics market is segmented into four major types: Prostaglandin Analogs, Beta Blockers, Alpha Agonists, and Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors. Prostaglandin Analogs are the most commonly prescribed medications for glaucoma as they are effective in reducing intraocular pressure. Beta Blockers work by decreasing the production of aqueous humor in the eye. Alpha Agonists help reduce intraocular pressure by increasing the outflow of aqueous humor. Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors also help reduce intraocular pressure by decreasing the production of aqueous humor.</p></p>
