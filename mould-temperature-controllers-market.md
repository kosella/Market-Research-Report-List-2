<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mould Temperature Controllers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oil Type</li><li>Water Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mould temperature controllers are used in plastic injection molding processes to regulate the temperature of the mould. There are two main types of mould temperature controllers: oil type and water type. Oil type controllers use oil as the heat transfer medium, providing faster heating and cooling cycles. Water type controllers use water for heat transfer, making them more energy efficient but less effective for high temperature applications. Both types offer precise temperature control and help improve the quality of molded products.</p></p>
