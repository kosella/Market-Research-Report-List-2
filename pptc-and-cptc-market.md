<p><strong>The PPTC and CPTC Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PPTC</li><li>CPTC</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polymer Positive Temperature Coefficient (PPTC) and Ceramic Positive Temperature Coefficient (CPTC) are two types of resettable fuses used in various electronic devices. PPTC fuses are made of polymer material that self-heats when current overload occurs, causing the fuse to trip and break the circuit. CPTC fuses are made of ceramic material and operate in a similar manner. Both types of fuses offer advantages such as reset capability, longer lifespan, and improved safety compared to traditional fuses.</p></p>
