<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cyber Security Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-premise</li><li>Cloud-based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cyber security solutions are offered in two main market types: on-premise and cloud-based. On-premise solutions involve installing and managing security systems directly on the company's premises, providing complete control over security measures. In contrast, cloud-based solutions are hosted on external servers and accessed through the Internet, offering scalability and flexibility. While on-premise solutions may be preferred for sensitive data and compliance requirements, cloud-based solutions are often chosen for their cost-effectiveness, ease of maintenance, and accessibility from anywhere.</p></p>
