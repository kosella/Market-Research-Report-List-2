<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Vehicle Differential Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gear Differential</li><li>Anti-Slip Differential</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gear differential is a type of differential that uses a system of gears to distribute power evenly to the wheels. This system is commonly used in heavy-duty commercial vehicles for better traction and stability. Anti-slip differential, on the other hand, is designed to prevent wheel slip by automatically transferring power to the wheel with better traction. This type of differential is often used in off-road and challenging terrains to improve driving performance and safety. Both gear and anti-slip differentials play a crucial role in enhancing the overall performance of commercial vehicles.</p></p>
