<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The In Circuit Tester Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-Automatic</li><li>Fully-Automatic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In Circuit Testers come in two main types: Semi-Automatic and Fully-Automatic. Semi-Automatic testers require some level of manual intervention from an operator during the testing process, such as loading and unloading boards or interpreting test results. On the other hand, Fully-Automatic testers are capable of performing tests without any human intervention, from board loading to result analysis. Fully-Automatic testers are more efficient and suitable for high-volume production environments, while Semi-Automatic testers are more cost-effective for smaller-scale operations.</p></p>
